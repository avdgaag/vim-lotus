{"name":"vim-lotus","tagline":"Vim plugin for working with Lotus projects","body":"# vim-lotus\r\n\r\nThis plugin helps you navigate and develop projects using the [Lotus web\r\nframework][lotus]. A Lotus project is detected by searching a .lotusrc file up\r\nthe directory hierarchy. When you edit a file in a Lotus project, this plugin\r\nwill be activated. This sets various options and defines some commands. It also\r\nintegrates with other Vim plugins.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Integrates with [vim-projectionist][] for navigating project files according\r\n  to Lotus conventions.\r\n* Comes with extra mappings for [vim-surround][].\r\n* Comes with extra snippets for [UltiSnips][].\r\n* Provides `:Lotus` command that delegates to the Lotus CLI.\r\n* Provides project-specific Vim navigation settings for `path` and\r\n  `suffixesadd`.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation (`:help lotus`) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nUse your favourite Vim plugin manager to install this plugin. I use\r\n[pathogen][]. Otherwise, download this plugin and put the files in its\r\nsubdirectories to the corresponding subdirectories in your `~/.vim` directory.\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nTo find our more about the Lotus framework, see: https://github.com/lotus/lotus\r\n\r\nTo get the latest updates or report bugs, see this plugin's Github repository: https://github.com/avdgaag/vim-lotus\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nAuthor: Arjan van der Gaag\r\nURL: http://arjanvandergaag.nl\r\n\r\nThis plugin is based on earlier work by Tim Pope, who has released many\r\nincredible Vim plugins.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSee LICENSE.\r\n\r\n[vim-projectionist]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist\r\n[vim-surround]:      https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround\r\n[UltiSnips]:         https://github.com/SirVer/UltiSnips\r\n[vim-pathogen]:      https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\r\n[lotus]:             https://github.com/lotus/lotus\r\n","google":"UA-20357800-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
